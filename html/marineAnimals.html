                <p>Most people think about whales, dolphins and otters when they think about the ocean. These are species of marine mammals - aquatic mammals that depend on the oceans and the marine ecosystem for survival. Adaptation of mammals to the marine ecosystem is varied. For example, cetaceans (whales, dolphins etc.) and sirenians (manatees, dugongs etc.) are fully aquatic mammals, but other mammals, such as seals and sea-lions are semi-aquatic - they spend most of their time underwater but need to return to land for other priorities such as mating and breeding.</p>

                <p>Mammals are a type of vertebrate, but there’s more types of vertebrates that are considered to be marine animals. Marine vertebrates are marine animals that have vertebral columns for internal support. These include fishes, reptiles, amphibians and even birds. Fishes can be jawless - hagfish, lampreys etc. - cartilaginous fish - made of cartilage rather than bone such as sharks and rays - or bony - carp, eel, pufferfish etc. Tetrapods, which are animals with limbs, that are aquatic include amphibians, reptiles - marine iguana, sea turtle, marine snakes etc. - and birds - penguins, seagulls, albatrosses etc. Did you know that even polar bears count as a marine animal?</p>

                <p>Marine invertebrates are aquatic animals that do not have a vertebral column to support their structure. To maintain structural integrity, most have evolved to form shells and hard exoskeletons. Major types of marine invertebrates includes sponges - bodies full of pores, cnidarians - presence of stinging cells for capturing prey such as jellyfishes, worms - distinguished by its long cylindrical body with no limbs, echinoderms - radial symmetry that are usually five-point such as starfishes and sea urchins, mollusks - protective shells such as colossal squid, nautilus and sea snails, and arthropods - segmented bodies with jointed limbs such as crustaceans (crabs).</p>
